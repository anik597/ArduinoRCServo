# Arduino-RC-Servo-Project
This Repository houses the code for my Freshman Year Physics Projects involving the Arduino UNO Microprocessor Board. 
This project involves controlling a few Servo Motors with precise speed, and uses the VarServoSpeed Library for the Arduino, 
which can be downloaded on GitHub as well. 

This readme will be dynamically updated as time goes on.
